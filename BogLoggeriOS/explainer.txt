I'm looking to build an iOS app to help track your poo. Eventually I want to make it for the watch, but right now, mobile is all I need to get started.

You can read more about the app idea here: https://bughuntersam.com/boglogger/

This app stores the time and rating of people's poop. My first version has no API's, all the data is stored locally. I'm using standard UI elements and SwiftUI.

There's 7 main features I'll need your help with;
syncing a log selection from a 1 to 7 list
Displaying that list of data in a calender view
Deleting an item from that list
Support for transalations (Only Arabic and Spanish)
Building Right to Left rendering to support Arabic
Automatically deleting data after 28 days
Building out an export function so people can share/backup their data

You won't need to bother with branding or making the UI look nice. I've started working on a sample project here: https://github.com/BugHunterSam/BogLogger/tree/master/BogLoggeriOS

I've got the spanish and arabic strings in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ht16Ud983U90UHCqQ8ASfbchnZpk6nIL03EiF3fTcTo/edit?usp=sharing

Are you able to help me? How much will this cost me?
